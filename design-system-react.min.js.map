The Modal opens from a state change outside of the component itself (pass this state to the <code>isOpen</code> prop). For more details on the Prompt markup, please review the <a href=\"http://www.lightningdesignsystem.com/components/notifications#prompt\">Notifications > Prompt</a>.\n\t *\n\t * By default, `Modal` will add `aria-hidden=true` to the `body` tag, but this disables some assistive technologies. To prevent this you can add the following to your application with `#mount` being the root node of your application that you would like to hide from assistive technologies when the `Modal` is open.\n\t * ```\n\t * import settings from 'design-system-react/components/settings';\n\t * settings.setAppElement('#mount');\n\t * ```\n\t */\n\t\n\tvar Modal = function (_React$Component) {\n\t\t_inherits(Modal, _React$Component);\n\t\n\t\tfunction Modal(props) {\n\t\t\t_classCallCheck(this, Modal);\n\t\n\t\t\tvar _this = _possibleConstructorReturn(this, (Modal.__proto__ || Object.getPrototypeOf(Modal)).call(this, props));\n\t\n\t\t\t_this.state = {\n\t\t\t\tisClosing: false,\n\t\t\t\trevealed: false\n\t\t\t};\n\t\n\t\t\t// Bind\n\t\t\t_this.handleModalClick = _this.handleModalClick.bind(_this);\n\t\t\t_this.closeModal = _this.closeModal.bind(_this);\n\t\t\t_this.dismissModalOnClickOutside = _this.dismissModalOnClickOutside.bind(_this);\n\t\t\treturn _this;\n\t\t}\n\t\n\t\t_createClass(Modal, [{\n\t\t\tkey: 'setReturnFocus',\n\t\t\tvalue: function setReturnFocus() {\n\t\t\t\tthis.setState({\n\t\t\t\t\treturnFocusTo: document.activeElement\n\t\t\t\t});\n\t\t\t}\n\t\t}, {\n\t\t\tkey: 'componentDidMount',\n\t\t\tvalue: function componentDidMount() {\n\t\t\t\tvar _this2 = this;\n\t\n\t\t\t\tthis.setReturnFocus();\n\t\n\t\t\t\tif (!this.state.revealed) {\n\t\t\t\t\tsetTimeout(function () {\n\t\t\t\t\t\t_this2.setState({ revealed: true });\n\t\t\t\t\t});\n\t\t\t\t}\n\t\t\t\tthis.updateBodyScroll();\n\t\t\t}\n\t\t}, {\n\t\t\tkey: 'componentDidUpdate',\n\t\t\tvalue: function componentDidUpdate(prevProps, prevState) {\n\t\t\t\tif (this.props.isOpen !== prevProps.isOpen) {\n\t\t\t\t\tthis.updateBodyScroll();\n\t\t\t\t}\n\t\t\t\tif (this.state.isClosing !== prevState.isClosing) {\n\t\t\t\t\tif (this.state.isClosing) {\n\t\t\t\t\t\t// console.log(\"CLOSING: ');\n\t\t\t\t\t\tif (!this.isUnmounting) {\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tvar el = _reactDom2.default.findDOMNode(this).parentNode;\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tif (el && el.getAttribute('data-slds-modal')) {\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t_reactDom2.default.unmountComponentAtNode(el);\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tdocument.body.removeChild(el);\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t}\n\t\t\t\t\t\t}\n\t\t\t\t\t}\n\t\t\t\t}\n\t\t\t}\n\t\t}, {\n\t\t\tkey: 'componentWillUnmount',\n\t\t\tvalue: function componentWillUnmount() {\n\t\t\t\tthis.isUnmounting = true;\n\t\t\t\tthis.clearBodyScroll();\n\t\t\t}\n\t\t}, {\n\t\t\tkey: 'dismissModalOnClickOutside',\n\t\t\tvalue: function dismissModalOnClickOutside() {\n\t\t\t\t// if dismissOnClickOutside is not set, default its value to dismissible\n\t\t\t\tvar dismissOnClickOutside = (0, _lodash2.default)(this.props.dismissOnClickOutside) ?
